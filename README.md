## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

* View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size.
* See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.

### Links

## My process

### Built with

* Semantic HTML5 markup
* CSS3 (custom properties and transitions)
* Flexbox for layout
* Media queries for responsiveness
* Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned how to:

* Build a flexible **responsive layout** using `flexbox` and media queries.
* Add **hover animations** on buttons and navigation links.
* Structure a news homepage with multiple sections like “Trending,” “New,” and featured content.

Example of hover transition I used:

```css
.home-btn {
  background-color: hsl(5, 85%, 63%);
  transition: all 0.5s ease-in-out;
}
.home-btn:hover {
  background-color: hsl(240, 100%, 5%);
  color: hsl(36, 100%, 99%);
}
```

### Continued development

In the future, I plan to:

* Add a **mobile menu toggle** for better navigation on smaller screens.
* Explore **CSS Grid** to improve layout management.
